## Happy House Pot Stickers

### Servings
Make about 35 pot stickers

### Ingredients

#### Filling
- [ ] .7 kg freshly ground pork butt
- [ ] .4 kg of cabbage
- [ ] 2 scallions
- [ ] 7 slices of ginger
- [ ] 5 cloves of garlic
- [ ] 1 Tablespoon of salt
- [ ] 1/2 tablespoon white pepper
- [ ] soy sauce
- [ ] oil

#### Wrapper
- [ ] all purpose flour
- [ ] water
- [ ] dash of salt

### Preparation Directions

#### Filling
1.	Dice the cabbage into small pieces as big as the ground pork bits. Do the same with the scallions. 
2.	Finely chop a generous amount of ginger and garlic. 
3.	Mix everything together until it forms a slightly round pink ball with green flecks. 
4.	Make sure to have a generous amount of scallions, ginger, garlic, and flavoring because this is what truly makes the filling delicious. 
5.	Once the filling is seasoned and mixed to your tastes, then place it onto a flat plate so you can easily scoop it when wrapping the dumplings. 

#### Wrapper
1.	Boil the water. 
2.	Add an equal amount of flour and water together with a dash of salt. Form into a well kneaded ball. 
3.	Then add a little more flour until the dough is slightly dry. But if it's too dry it'll be hard to form them into balls later. Cover to keep moist. 
4.	Roll the dough into a snake like shape. With your hands, snip off foosball sized pieces which you then form into balls. 
5.	Lightly flatten the balls in the middle then use a rolling pin to complete the procedure into making them into in flat disks. 
Scoop about a small foosball amount of filling into the flat disks. Then fold and stitch the wrapper together to form a dumpling. If there is too much filling, then scrap it back into the plate full of filling. 

### Cooking
1.	Place the pot stickers in the frying pan on medium heat. Completely cover them up until the frills with water. 
2.	Cover then wait 20 minutes. 
3.	Drain the water. Add oil to the pan until it coats the bottom of the pot stickers. 
4.	Once the bottoms are crisply brown, take them off the pan and serve them with soy sauce mixed with vinegar
